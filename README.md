Handsonlabs in php.mysql Book Codes

Welcome to the future!

I have made diligent effort to lay out the codes in the "Handsonlabs in Php.MySql:The fired up practical experience", in a very schematic and systematic manner.
In order to get the best out of these codes, please read each chapter one by one. This is highly recommended. The exception to this recommendation is if you are already a high tech programmer and you know for sure what you are doing.
Next, Chapter 2 lays out how to set up your environment, you should especially if you are new to programming, take careful note of this chapter. It will help you master the directory of an open source, Apache based Web Application Development.
The main purpose of this source code is to help you code along easily as you read the book.
This book came live Worldwide on the 15th of June, 2013 and less than seven days later, precisely on the 22nd of June, 2013 some dare programmers had already bought the book and wrote their comments about the book. I have included an abbreviated form of their comments on "Handsonlabs in Php.MySql:The fired up practical experience", as an introductory, independent Editorial review on http://amazon.com
Please refer to:

Kindle edition for details.
You can search through Google, Yahoo, Bing (MSN) or any other recognized seearch engine for this book. Just type “The fired up practical Experience”, or “Handsonlabs in php.mysql”. I prefer the 1st choice  (“The fired up practical Experience”),  though. Any of the searches especially the 1st one returns this book in sandbox search and 1st on the search list. So getting this book on the internet for purchase is pretty easy.
Specifically, two of them wrote on the absence of the source-code referred to in the book. This is true; this source code came a month and half later (26th of July 2013) than when the book was actually released. One of them referred to "...my day job", (lol) as not an excuse. He is certainly right.
 I really appreciate their comments and look forward to more of such so I can write better to meet the yearning needs of programmers Worldwide.
